# odin-recipes
First Project from TOP

This project is about the use of skill to do
HTML pages, to do a central page that contains
recipes, and this recipes have content by itself.
Also to apply Git and GitHub basic dominion.

Finished. Published 3 recipes and added to Github.

Note: Actually, this is my second try onthe project,
the first one I made the recipes with full success,
but I have serious troubles to push them to Github,
at some point I have maded other branch trying to
make it to Github, this branches couldn't be merged,
my last solution was to copy all the code to other
place, erase the directory and the repo of odin-recipes
from local and GitHub, then repite all the process,
just coping the the code and following the Git/GitHub
instructions with close care. This time I made it well.
